Extra time questions

4a.
When it comes to validation we would consider what fields we'd like to validate and create functions that would do the validating. Fields React already validates the email and DOB field. In my example, I would consider creating a function to validate phone number or find a library that does that for me. 

The same when it comes to an empty field. It depends on what we want to do with the data we're collecting in the form. If the field can't be emppty, then I would consider making it a required field.

In my implementation, I hardcoded the required field. But it should be possible to make a field required by using the same logic I did with the conditional rendering of the form. In other words create a function that will serve as a true/false flag and then let required= that function.

To imporove on the design, I probably would attempt to use Bootstrap instead of free CSS.
I think this would have made it easier from the developer side and also potential support side. It might also be better from the user perspective since they are probably more used to seeing websites designed using Bootstrap.
